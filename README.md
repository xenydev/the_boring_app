# The Boring App

The boring app is a flutter app made for me for learning propuses.

## About

The app shows a random recommended activity you can do when you are bored. Also you can save them for later.

The app has theming, routing, riverpod state managment, api call, error catching and something more.

Shout-out to https://www.boredapi.com/ is the one I use to show the activities.

I'm new at flutter but I think the code is kinda well written and organized.

### Todo's

- Store saved activities locally
- Mark as done the activities (done)
- Mark all done option
- Delete all option (done)
- Make saved screen with tabs and save toggle as done
- Media query
